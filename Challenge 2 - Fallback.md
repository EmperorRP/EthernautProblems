# Ethernaut Challenge #2 - Fallback

Here we go! Let's start with the first line:
```solidity
 pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
```

This line specifies the version of solidity we will be using in this contract. In our case, we are using any version of solidity that is 0.6.0 or higher.

```solidity
import '@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol';
```
We are importing the SafeMath library which is a useful library when doing some math operations. 


```solidity
contract Fallback
```
With this line, we are declaring a new contrawct named Fallback. Inside this contract is where we will code out the functions and variables of the contract.
